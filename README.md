DeadlyDimensions

I made this mod to work in a modpack I was developing. The idea came around because I needed to stop players being out in just any dimension. I wanted to restrict them to being stuck in a dimension of my choosing until a time they were op enough to venture to the others. Hence this mod. Does it have a large use in the community, you tell me? Im not sure but I thought seeing as it was made and done I might as well put it out there for people to try. I am thinking of implementing new dimensions with effects, and maybe also making it more customizable (however it already is pretty customizable now!).

Hope you enjoy
